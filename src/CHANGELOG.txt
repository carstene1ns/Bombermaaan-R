Next version

New feature: Bombs can be remotely fused by a bomber (by Jerome Bigot, revision 527, #2122157) including AI support (by Markus Drescher, revision 536).
New feature: AI bomber is punching bombs when he is jammed by a bomb and picked up the punch item (by Markus Drescher).
New feature: Bombermaaan can be compiled natively on Linux using G++ (without the need of Wine and the Bombermaaan files for Win32, thanks to Markus Drescher, revision 533).
New feature: AI support for the blue glove - the AI players can throw bombs now (by Markus Drescher, revision 536).
New feature: Levels may have remote fused bombs (can also be set in level file version 2).
Changed: FMOD was replaced by the SDL_mixer library (by Markus Drescher, revision 533).
Changed: When no config file is present the input for the second player is set to keyboard 2 (revision 547).
Changed: Bigger sprites in menu level preview in 32-pixels version (revision 542).
Changed: F1 and F2 keys don't switch to fullscreen mode in 32-pixels version since the screen resolution is too low and the graphics cannot be seen completely.
Changed: Configuration file stored in XML format, config.xml (#2121910). The old file config.dat is still read for easy migration (this feature will be removed in the future).
Changed: Bots "know" which bomb is ignited by another bomb.
Changed: Algorithm for bots choosing the best block to escape / defend theirselves.
Changed: Keyboard 3 to 5 as human input available now. Useful if you don't have joysticks (#2150405).
Changed: Using SimpleIni for reading version-2 level files. The level files can be treated as real INI files now.
Changed: Arrows are displayed in level preview now (where bombs start moving, #2153008).
Bug fix: Input field was empty / executable crashed when joystick isn't present the next game start (#2121904, revision 538, revision 539, revision 546).
Bug fix: Bots are escaping in a certain situation if a player surrounds a bot with bombs.
Bug fix: Sometimes bots were stuck in the "WALK MODE". If they stay in there too often, they exit the "WALK MODE".
Bug fix: A bomb could have been "lifted again" if it already was lifted.
Bug fix: A level could contain too many items (in walls/initial skills of the bomber). That means the sum of maximum items must not exceed 50. (Initial skill items * 5 + Items in Walls <= 50)
Bug fix: Sometimes too many walls were created causing a game crash.

Fixed bug where two items could be created on the same block when two or more bombers were killed at the same time.
The program now doesn't crash if you ask for a fullscreen display mode (with F1, F2 or F3) that is unsupported on your video card. It doesn't do anything instead.
Made a DEMO mode! Well, it's not useful, but hey, I find it cool :) You can launch it from the title screen.
Added an icon to the window and to the executable file. That's usually the first thing people do when creating a game, but so far I didn't know how to do it :) Ooops, almost forgot. Thanks to Florian Freiwald for drawing this nice bomber icon.
Now checks if Bomberman.dat exists at startup.
Reduced time to wait between menus each time you validate.
Fixed a potential bug in AI.
Changed the lightness/contrast of one background tile in the winner screen.
You can now quickly exit the game by pressing Ctrl+F12.

Added clouds to the title screen.
The bombers in the menu screen now blink their eyes.

The pause and the hurry up messages in the match screen now appear and disappear by scrolling.
Fixed tiny bug when choosing only computer players in a match (the input menu is now skipped).
Fixed bug when switching from menu screen to match screen.
Now possible to make customized level layouts by editing simple text files (L1.txt, L2.txt, ...)
Now possible to set an infinite time for a match, which means a battle won't end before there is only one alive bomber left.

----------------------------


Version 0.85

----------------------------


Version 0.8

Fixed a nasty bomb explosion bug that was here from the beginning! When a bomb exploded, two explosions were created.
When an explosion hits a skull item, the item now starts flying away and lands somewhere else.
When a sick bomber picks up an item, a flying skull item is now released and will land somewhere.
The kick item comes back! Computer players now sometimes use it to get out of trouble.


----------------------------


Version 0.77

Released on November 16, 2001

Added the possibility to pause the match by pressing P on the keyboard. Message with sound.

Added the horizontal and the vertical arena closing. (The first was the spiral arena closing).
A random arena closing (among horizontal, vertical and spiral) is chosen for each battle.
Added fumes animations (with sound) for each item returned by a bomber who just died.
The sound is now paused when the window loses the focus.
You can now have the menu box (by hitting escape) anywhere in the game.
Fixed sickness contamination bug: when a bomber was sick in a group of 2+ bombers which moved on the same blocks, the sick bomber contaminated another one, who contaminated another one, etc. This was also very noisy.
Changed bomber head sprites on the board: a dead bomber's head is now represented by a special sprite.


----------------------------


Version 0.75

Released on November 5, 2001

Added some SOUND (finally!) using the FMOD library. Wahoooo the game is much much more fun to play now!
Sound files and image files are now packed in a unique DLL.
Fixed a nasty sound bug in the menu (damn, I didn't know VC++ could "forget" to warn me when I'm using an invalid object!) : I couldn't play any sound except the music!!
Decreased the time computer players wait before starting playing.
Fixed a little and invisible bug in the menu that could have been tricky.
Added the bell sound (ding ding ding ding ding!) when there is a winner.
The match and menu song now start after the first black screen has ended and stop before the last black screen has started.
When there is a draw game, the match song now stops before the dying bombers start screaming. Cool effect!
Fixed a bug of the cool effect above : if the draw game happened when the arena was entirely closed, the song stopped and then started again after the bombers screams.
Made the bomber invulnerable when he has just won the current match.
Added an error sound when the user choices are not correct in the menu.
Added a little sound when the winner screen is shown.
Added sound when a bomber picks up a skull item and when a sick bomber contaminates another bomber.
Added a HURRY UP message and a sound before the arena starts closing.
Computer players now take items without checking if they are in a dead end. It's better like this for the moment.
Computer players now try to go to the block that will be closed last when the arena is almost entirely closed.
Fixed bug where computer players could actually drop bombs in front of soft walls that are burning or that will soon burn. In fact it didn't work.
Made little fix so that computer players don't drop a bomb if there are only dangerous blocks around them. They now kill themselves less often.
When there are no safe block to go to, computer players now try to go to the less dangerous block. They are now much better when the arena is almost entirely closed.
When they are trying to pick up an item, computer players now check if this item is still interesting.
Decreased the draw game screen's duration.
Added sound to the victory screen. Modified animation times in this screen to adapt to the sound.
Computer players now check other items even when they are trying to pick up one.
The skull item comes back! The AI is not very good at handling it, but at least it's here again.


----------------------------

Released on October 30, 2001

Computer players can move from one block to another.
Computer players avoid bombs and try to burn walls and pick up items.
Computer players drop bombs in order to kill their ennemies.
Added little breaks when computer players are playing. This makes them more human.
Computer players don't drop a bomb on any block : they first check if they will be able to go to a safe block after dropping it.
Computer players now take distance into account before going to a block and drop a bomb there in order to burn soft walls (they were only checking the number of soft walls they could burn).
Changed little breaks durations (now depends on the context).
Fixed bug where computer players didn't always wait for soft walls to burn and started doing something else in the meanwhile.
Fixed bug where computer players did not always correctly avoid danger (blocked by bombs).
Computer players take bombs flame size into account when detecting the danger.
Fixed bug where computer players accepted to walk on mortal blocks when they were on a block that would soon be mortal.
Computer players prefer to pick up good items first, and won't pick up the skull item. They also prefer not going in a dead end in order to pick up an item.
Fixed little problem in the code that checks if it's ok to drop a bomb.
Fixed bug where computer players didn't mind dropping a bomb in front of a burning soft wall or a soft wall that would soon burn (which could burn items).
Fixed bug where computer players sometimes didn't know what to do when there was nothing interesting around.
Added some debug features in the program in order to be able to modify the game's speed for example.
Added more precision to danger detection.
Added danger detection of falling walls when the arena is closing.
Draw Game, Winner and Victory screens now don't react anymore to player controls (the ones you can configure) but to menu controls (up down left right return backspace).
Computer players have to be closer to an enemy to attack.
Removed temporarily skull and kick item. The AI needs more work to take them into account.


----------------------------


Version 0.6

Made better logging system. The execution of the program is logged to a file. This helps a lot when trying to understand errors (especially DirectX errors).
Fixed memory leak in video memory.

Separated the graphics from the executable. Two files : an EXE + a DLL.
Changed controls: White bomber is controlled with Arrows + L + K, black bomber is controlled with RFDG + 2 + 1 
Added a menu which allows to set the type of each bomber. Less than 2 MAN bombers or more than 0 COM bomber is not allowed.
Modified winner bomber animation timing in victory screen.
Added a colored cross in the scoreboard screen for each non-playing bomber.
Added a menu to set the number of battles (from 1 to 5) in the match, and the start time of the clock (from 1:00 to 5:00). If the start time of the clock is 1:00, then the arena will start closing at 0:40, otherwise at 1:00.
Disabled monitor power and screen saver activation when running the game.
Joystick support! Two keyboard configurations available: Keyboard 1 : 8/5/4/6/PageUp/Home, Keyboard 2 : R/F/D/G/2/1
